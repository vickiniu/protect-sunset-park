# protect-sunset-park

This project is hosted at [protectsunsetpark.glitch.me](https://protectsunsetpark.glitch.me/), and is a
dialer to support [Protect Sunset Park](https://www.protectsunsetpark.org/) in organizing against the 
rezoning of Industry City.

After months of incredible organizing and advocacy from Protect Sunset Park and other community organizations
in Sunset Park and South Brooklyn, [the Industry City rezoning deal was halted](https://www.curbed.com/2020/09/industry-city-rezoning-defeated-nyc-development.html).
